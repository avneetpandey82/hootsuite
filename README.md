# SmartSocial â€“ AI Social Post Generator & Scheduler

A mini SaaS tool to generate and schedule AI-powered social media content.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** frontend (Azure Static Web Apps)

- **Azure OpenAI** for post generation
- **Azure Cosmos DB** for storing scheduled posts

## Setup

### 1. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Copy the template file and add your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp local.settings.template.json local.settings.json
   ```

3. Update `local.settings.json` with your actual credentials:

   - Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Get your Cosmos DB URI and key from Azure Portal

4. Install dependencies:
